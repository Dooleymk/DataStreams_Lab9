I am your fearless leader
But you are in control
You have the face of darkness
My own thoughts are always wrong
Am I the son of evil
In this mad masquerade
I know what's waiting for me
I will be the one to blame

One more time
Fight just a little bit
One more time
One more ride
You're breaking your promise
And every day
You're lying to me
Step by step
We try a little longer
Adapt one more time
I'm leaving bad memories behind me

You are a big pretender
The one that knows it all
An egocentric figure
Stabbing backs
To reach your goals
I scream to make you hear me
I lie to underline
What you are doing to me
You have crossed the borderline

One more time
Fight just a little bit
One more time
One more ride
You're breaking your promise
And every day
You're lying to me
Step by step
We try a little longer
Adapt one more time
I'm leaving bad memories behind me
