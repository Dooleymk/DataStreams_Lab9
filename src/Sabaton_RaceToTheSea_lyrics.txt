We’re keeping the kingdom free

As an archduke falls and the battle horn calls
our lives would never be the same
We were looking down the barrel of a gun
Now the war has come and the battle has begun
we are desperate and overrun
To the war drum we’ll be marching until it’s done

Lead the way, we will follow into the fray
We will hold the line we will not be led astray

For king and for country we, are flooding the river
Our stand at Yser will be, the end of the race to the sea
The last piece of Belgium is free, we’re keeping a sliver
A cog in the war machine, October of 1914

As our foe draws forth we are moving on north
we will never let them have it all
There’s a price for freedom paid by Belgium’s sons
They may take our towns, they may conquer our grounds
we’ll defend the nation and the crown
We’ll uphold our independence with our guns

All the way, on to triumph or to judgement day
We will follow and we will not be led astray

See a king and a soldier, fighting shoulder to shoulder
See a king and a soldier, fighting shoulder to shoulder
He overruled his commanders, he made a last stand in Flanders
We see our king and a soldier,
they’re fighting shoulder to shoulder
To keep the last piece of Belgium free

All the way, on to triumph or to judgement day
We will follow and we will not be led astray

For king and for country we are flooding the river
Our stand at Yser will be, the end of the race to the sea
We’re free
For king and for country we are flooding the river
No more of our country lost, the line will be held at all cost
