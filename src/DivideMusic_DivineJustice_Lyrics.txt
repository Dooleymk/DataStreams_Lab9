I am, I am the sun that rose above the day
When you had nothing left for me
The moment, the moment your life gave itself away
I used to think they could really see
What a true god is
Try and follow this
What a true god is (you're all false gods)
I have finished it
Higher perspective, you'll never find the time
'Cause you've infected what strength you had inside
I'll cut the very root of the problem, nothing left to see
(Divine justice)
Higher perspective, I'll keep them all in line
'Cause you've injected these lies into their minds
I'll cut the very root of the problem, you can keep your plea
(Divine justice)
You'll see the skies
Return on your demise
You saw a window and tried a getaway
But you can't hide forever
Leaving in ruins, the paths you set for me
Can you feel the pressure?
Of what a true god is
You'll never understand
Try and follow this
No one to hold your hand
When I have finished it
Another grain of sand
Higher perspective, you'll never find the time
'Cause you've infected what strength you had inside
I'll cut the very root of the problem, nothing left to see
(Divine justice)
Higher perspective, I'll keep them all in line
'Cause you've injected these lies into their minds
I'll cut the very root of the problem, you can keep your plea
(Divine justice)
Now that the time has arrived, I will savour every moment
You have nowhere to hide
(Nowhere to) hide
Nowhere to hide
Now that the time has arrived, I will savour every moment
You have nowhere to hide
You have nowhere to hide
Now that the time has arrived, I will savour every moment
You have nowhere to hide
